! MOST IMPORTANT FOR RELEASE !

+ websub check

// only after release!
+ Think where signifier exposure mechanism could fit in yggdrasil
+ Implement small version with xArm example
+ think of interesting domain use case for context aware signifiers


++ LIST OF FEATURES ++
- WebID
  - Issue 39 & 40 - Regarding WebID & Change of join / leave API
    - Change that join and leave refer to agent body resource.
      - Joining would be done by POST request to body.
      - Leaving would be done by DELETE request to body.
    - Allow more WebIDs
      - Comply with the Web ID Standard
      - Future support for SOLID OIDC
  - Implement authentication mechanism
  - Issue 42 - Should be implemented now, atleast with HMAS
    - The agent representations could be redundant, notably if no other motivating use case can be found.
      - Agents are representations are just artifacts


  - Issue 44 - Update architecture file


  - Issue 45 - Remove last singleton -> HypermediaArtifactRegistry
    - make it a class only used by cartago verticle
    -> Should only be used by cartago verticle already
    -> Except for 1 method in HttpHandler for handleAction

- Check Correct URIs everywhere

TODOS:
  Still need to write the hmas tests for the core tests
  Rewriting of DefaultHttpHandlers since we always need cartago atm
  -> What to do about that?
