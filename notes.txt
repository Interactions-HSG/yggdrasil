General:
	- No need to differentiate between focus / subscribe WebSub artifact -> All artifacts are cartago artifacts

API:
	Platform:
	+ / - GET
	+ /query/ - GET POST ?- missing
	- /hub/ - NO LONGER NEEDED

	Workspace:
	+ /workspaces/ - POST
	+ /workspaces/{wrkspid}/ - GET POST PUT DELETE
	+ /workspaces/{wrkspid}/join - POST
	+ /workspaces/{wrkspid}/leave - POST
	- /workspaces/{wrkspid}/focus - NO LONGER NEEDED -> In artifact itself

	Artifact:
	+ /workspaces/{wrkspid}/artifacts/ - POST
	+ /workspaces/{wrkspid}/artifacts/{artifact}/ - GET POST PUT DELETE
	+ /workspaces/{wrkspid}/artifacts/{artifact}/focus/ - NEW POST

	body:
	-> REMOVED? since we give agents now also artifact uri in platform?




# New

- Combined all classes where it was possible
- Most classes do not depend on ontology anymore
- Only rdfstoreverticle and cartagoVerticle have a if statement to decide which RepresentationFactor to use

- Made it so that when you create an artifact through turtle it is built on top of cartago base artifact
-> this artifact needs to be in the environment config.

- Need solution for adding artifacts and workspaces through turtle on how to modify the graph
-> need to overwrite certain uris and delete others while keeping all others

-> The API for /../../artifacts/artifact/{action} could be removed?
 -> Add the endpoints to the artifacts themselves? would make more sense?
 -> URL would be the same in the end just not in presented in the swagger specs and handles by artifacts themselves and not rdfverticle?

// question of base cartago artifact

+ add list of missing features (e.g.: WebID, Interface to Cartago(feedbackParams, etc) )

! MOST IMPORTANT FOR RELEASE !
+ Try to pull handleAction method into Artifacts themselves -> HypermediaArtifact should handle the action
+ look at feedbackParams specifically
+ add slug to body for joinworkspace

+ websub check

// only after release!
+ Think where signifier exposure mechanism could fit in yggdrasil
+ Implement small version with xArm example
+ think of interesting domain use case for context aware signifiers

+ create new util class to make artifacts from turtle
 -> do not need cartago for it anymore
 -> Util clas would need to have access to RepresentationFactory
 -> Util class would create the artifactRepresentations and merge it with the request turtle representation

!MISSING FEATURES
- WebID
- issues by matteo

list of critical points still missing for next week

TESTS

+ ADD TEST FOR TURTLE ARTIFACT CREATION
+ ADD TEST FOR TURTLE WORKSPACE CREATION
+ STATUS CODE TESTS ACCORDING TO SWAGGER SPECS

+ TEST CASES WITH DIFFERENT SLUG CASES -> what happens if slug already taken

++ LIST OF FEATURES ++
