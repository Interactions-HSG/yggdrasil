! MOST IMPORTANT FOR RELEASE !
+ Try to pull handleAction method into Artifacts themselves -> HypermediaArtifact should handle the action <- DONE
+ look at feedbackParams specifically <- DONE theyre there
+ add slug to body for joinworkspace <- DONE

+ websub check

// only after release!
+ Think where signifier exposure mechanism could fit in yggdrasil
+ Implement small version with xArm example
+ think of interesting domain use case for context aware signifiers


++ LIST OF FEATURES ++
- WebID
- Issues on Github:
  - Artifacts currently expose Thing Descriptions but agents have no such profile. Profiles for agents should be created.
    - tbd
  - The actions that the agents use to interact with the Web of Things and process JSON documents are defined within the agent architecture.
    These actions should instead be made available through libraries.
    - close issue


  - Issue 39 & 40 - Regarding WebID & Change of join / leave API
    - Change that join and leave refer to agent body resource.
      - Joining would be done by POST request to body.
      - Leaving would be done by DELETE request to body.
    - Allow more WebIDs
      - Comply with the Web ID Standard
      - Future support for SOLID OIDC
  - Implement authentication mechanism
  - Issue 42 - Should be implemented now, atleast with HMAS
    - The agent representations could be redundant, notably if no other motivating use case can be found.
      - Agents are representations are just artifacts


  - Issue 43 - Should be solved with RepresentationFactoryFactory


  - Issue 44 - Update architecture file


  - Issue 45 - Remove last singleton -> HypermediaArtifactRegistry
    - make it a class only used by cartago verticle
    -> Should only be used by cartago verticle already
    -> Except for 1 method in HttpHandler for handleAction


- Check Correct URIs everywhere


- Add Tests
  - TEST CASES WITH DIFFERENT SLUG CASES -> what happens if slug already taken
    - Added testcase for Workspaces
  - ADD TEST FOR TURTLE ARTIFACT CREATION
    - tests present
  - ADD TEST FOR TURTLE WORKSPACE CREATION
    - tests present
  - STATUS CODE TESTS ACCORDING TO SWAGGER SPECS
    - tests present



QUESTIONS:
 - Graph queries
 -> Correct representation of resource profile and the actual #things
  -> <workspaces/sub/> hmas:isContainedIn <workspaces/test/> .
  -> <workspaces/test/> a hmas:Workspace .
  BUT
  -> <workspaces/sub/#workspace> hmas:contains <workspaces/sub/artifacts/c0/#artifact> .
  -> <workspaces/sub/artifacts/c0/#artifact> a hmas:Artifact .

  -> Would need to overhaul the TDs a bit so that graph queries work?

 - DELETE only removes from rdf store not cartago?
 - ADD TO CARTAGO

TODOS:
  Still need to write the hmas tests for the core tests
  Rewriting of DefaultHttpHandlers since we always need cartago atm
  -> What to do about that?


++ OUTPUT SCHEMA IN THE REGISTER ACTION AFFORDANCE -> DEFINE OUTPUT AS ARRAY SPEC
  ++ NEW REPRESENTATION


++++++++++++++++++++++

+ Tests refactored so they use same classes if appropriate

+ Jacamo:Body is added to workspace containing body artifact

+ Signal works

+ Deleting an Entity doesnt delete it from cartago

+ update TD representation same as HMAS

+ description of feedbackparams

+ display error if user tries to start yggdrasil without specifying ontology in environment conf

+ add testcase for artifact with feedbackparam and no payload

+ update swagger api docs
