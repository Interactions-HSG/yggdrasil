! MOST IMPORTANT FOR RELEASE !

+ websub check

// only after release!
+ Think where signifier exposure mechanism could fit in yggdrasil
+ Implement small version with xArm example
+ think of interesting domain use case for context aware signifiers
  + still smart factory where agent has public goal and receives only relevant signifiers



++ LIST OF FEATURES ++
- WebID
  - Issue 39 & 40 - Regarding WebID & Change of join / leave API
    - Change that join and leave refer to agent body resource.
      - Joining would be done by POST request to body.
      - Leaving would be done by DELETE request to body.
    - Allow more WebIDs
      - Comply with the Web ID Standard
      - Future support for SOLID OIDC
  - Implement authentication mechanism
  - Issue 42 - Should be implemented now, atleast with HMAS
    - The agent representations could be redundant, notably if no other motivating use case can be found.
      - Agents are representations are just artifacts


  - Issue 44 - Update architecture file


++++++++++++++++++++++

IMPLEMENTED:
- HypermediaArtifactRegistry no longer a singleton (ISSUE 45)
  - Only problem is the apiKey since artifacts cannot access the registry in their methods (PhantomX3D)
  - Could make it so that apiKeys are input params to @Operation methods
  - If apiKey is input param then no need to specify it as header?
  - Or apiKey special case of input param? -> would have to specify that apiKey always first param or something like that
  - getKey method in Artifact

- Cartago updated, all actions should work + deletion of workspaces
  - Only problem is do not know what I am missing from Matteos version

- Artifacts refactored, output specifications are now needed
  - Same as input, but for output

- No longer dependent on Cartago
  - EntityHandler has representationFactory injected and builds representation in case cartago is not used
  - There is a case for extending representationFactory as a verticle itself. This would increase flexibility
    and extensibility. Representation could be part of the message flow, just before the rdf message. Either with called
    with input from cartago verticle or from entity handler directly.


- Default ontology is TD


QUESTIONS:
- Base representation currently has websub should this be dependent on notification enabled?
- Update of TD representation for base things -> can we specify input?
- Cartago Version -> need some sort of uniformity. Establish our base version

TODO:
- Still need to fix focus behaviour -> differentiate between cartago focus and websub focus
- differentiate between resource profiles and cartago events
- new topic that ends with "focus" for observable events / properties in cartago <- should only be exposed by entity running on cartago


USE CASES:
- Highly distributed system. Where microservices talk to eachother
- Can use HMAS to dynamically set the used URIs for semantically set endpoints
  - To increase efficiency just have the microservices subscribed via websub
    That way only when uris change you need to query the representation again


++++++++++++
NEW:
  setup specific cartago version for yggdrasil
  for representations add subProtocol() TD for websub
  Websub Topics -> what to do

  Signifiers -> mechanism
  Jacamo Hypermedia jitpack cannot be used to build
  HMAS JAVA:
    recommended abilities
    agent context
    recommended abilitites extracted from signifier compare to agent context

  authentication -> probably happens upon joining

  mailboxes with affordances exposed via the agent body
  how to support agent messages -> agent to agent communication
  -> through websub
  -> can extend body to add affordances and signifiers




+ Update configs
+ swagger api
+ updating documentation in general!
