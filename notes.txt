Problems for merging TD and HMAS:
- Yggdrasil-Core: RdfStoreVerticle
	- RdfStoreVerticle handles creation of Workspace / platform / artifacts / bodies
	- Adds ontology specific prefixes in creation
	-> If we can strip RdfStoreVerticle of anything ontology specific we can use it as our RDF Store

- Yggdrasil-Core: HttpEntityHandler
	- Only really depends on ontology if we create through turtle
	- Since we decide what to instanciate through first rdf triple
	-> Split createEntity into different methods to handle each case
	-> Each case separately called per endpoint
	-> No need to check turtle for that

	-> TD Implementation only handled cartago operations that used json arrays
	-> What to do with HMAS?
	-> What to do with more complicated input?


- Yggrdasil-Cartago: HypermediaArtifact
	- Strong(er) coupling due to registering of signifiers
	- Also TD has security schemes
	-> No clear way of dual usage
	-> Could have two methods of creating Signifiers?

- Yggdrasil-Utils: RepresentationFactoryImpl
	- Obviously we would need two different factories
	- Could check if some input stays the same so we can use same interface
	- Problem arises here because of securityschemes
	-> Should not be a problem to have two implementations of the interface
	-> How to decide which on to use depending on chosen ontology?
		-> Similar as to other configuration where we pass the correct impl to the verticle?


General:
	- No need to differentiate between focus / subscribe WebSub artifact -> All artifacts are cartago artifacts

API:
	Platform:
	+ / - GET
	+ /query/ - GET POST ?- missing
	- /hub/ - NO LONGER NEEDED

	Workspace:
	+ /workspaces/ - POST
	+ /workspaces/{wrkspid}/ - GET POST PUT DELETE
	+ /workspaces/{wrkspid}/join - POST
	+ /workspaces/{wrkspid}/leave - POST
	- /workspaces/{wrkspid}/focus - NO LONGER NEEDED -> In artifact itself

	Artifact:
	+ /workspaces/{wrkspid}/artifacts/ - POST
	+ /workspaces/{wrkspid}/artifacts/{artifact}/ - GET POST PUT DELETE
	+ /workspaces/{wrkspid}/artifacts/{artifact}/focus/ - NEW POST

	body:
	-> REMOVED? since we give agents now also artifact uri in platform?




# NOTES ON IMPLEMENTATION
- RepresentationFactory Interface imposes methods for creating representations -> return null
- Different implementations of uri wrappers -> trailing slash



RDFSTore to many responsibilities
Representation coupled with cartago <- cartagoVerticle does not depend on ontology
createEntity refactor
