= Yggdrasil

A platform for _hypermedia multi-agent systems (MAS)_ (see [1]) built with https://vertx.io/[Vert.x].

The current prototype implementation provides two core functionalities:

* it servers as a repository for hypermedia environments that conform to the _Agents & Artifacts_ meta-model [2]

* it acts as a hub that partially implements the https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-websub-20180123/[W3C WebSub recommendation].

== Prerequisites

* JDK 8+


== Building the project

To build the project, just use:

----
./gradlew shadowJar
----
